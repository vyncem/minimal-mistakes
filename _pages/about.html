                    Traditional death notices, obituaries, and tributes are dry, bland, formulaic and drab.

                    If you brave the dull read, you only end up knowing the deceased's name, date of birth and death, where they schooled, where they worked and who they're related to.

                    You never get a sense of who they were as a person: how their loved ones felt about them, how they made their loved ones feel, what mattered to them, how they impacted those around them and how they were impacted by those around them. The void they leave behind is never reflected.

                    When my father passed away in May of 2025 I decided to do something different. I wanted to create a tribute that was not only a celebration of his life but also a reflection of his personality and the love he shared with those around him.

                <div class="mx-auto mt-3 text-white">
                    A seasoned journalist interviewed my late father's family, friends and colleagues. He drafted a tribute reflecting the anecdotes, sentiments and feelings; both verbal and unsaid. After a few edits, in consultation with the family, what emerged was an enlightening, heartfelt and honest reflection of my father.

                    All that was left to do was to erect a digital tombstone to publish the work and echo the true essence of my father in perpetuity.
